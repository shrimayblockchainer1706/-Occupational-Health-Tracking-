# Occupational Health Tracking

## Description

The Occupational Health Tracking smart contract is a decentralized solution built on the Aptos blockchain that revolutionizes how organizations manage employee health records and workplace safety data. This contract provides a secure, transparent, and immutable system for tracking employee health metrics, workplace incidents, and medical clearances in real-time.

The contract features a streamlined architecture with two core functions that handle the complete lifecycle of employee health management. The `create_health_record` function initializes comprehensive health profiles for employees, while the `update_health_data` function maintains current health information following medical checkups or workplace incidents. Each health record contains critical data including unique employee identification, standardized health scores (1-10 scale), incident tracking, medical clearance status, and timestamped health assessments.

Built with enterprise-grade security, the contract implements robust input validation, comprehensive error handling, and signer-based authentication to ensure only authorized personnel can access and modify sensitive health information. This blockchain-based approach eliminates data tampering risks while providing complete audit trails for regulatory compliance and organizational accountability.
